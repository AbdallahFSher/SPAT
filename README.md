# Sher Python Automation Library (SPAT)
This is just a repo that hold scripts that I write to automate tasks in python!

Scripts
- downloadRSStoPlex.py
	I wrote this script to download my favorite podcast directly to my Plex server, but really it can be used to automate the downloading of any RSS Feed
